# Example Journal Entry

Today, I worked on:

* Creating our database schema and mapping table details out in drawSQL (led by me)
* Setting up the rest of our project, configuring Docker files (led by Jerry), getting our project up and running in Docker. We had a minor setback in our ability to connect to the remote repository, but were able to resolve with the help of Matt!
* Reviewing and aligning on our latest updated wireframes (led by Isaiah)
