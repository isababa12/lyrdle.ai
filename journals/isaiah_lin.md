Today my team wanted to adjust the UI/UX design of the application. We created a new wireframe together. Harry and I pair programmed via LiveShare to create a new NavBar to match the direction of our Wireframe. This new NavBar also re-renders whenever the status of the user's token changes. After creating the UX frame work for these buttons and NavBar we merged into main branch and deployment with no problems. Jerry will be going in to make sure the final styles and designs on each page are consistent and follows our brand's theme.

My team and I had a big discussion in regards to communication today. I did not have a good look to be honest, and a lot of this came from lack of communication and my passive-aggressive nature allowing this to pressurize and explode. I have learned it is very important for me to keep up a consistent communication channel as well as to be less passive-aggressive and let my ture feelings be heard sooner rather than later when I may lose self-control.

Today I was also able to get a lot of work done. I enhanced the UX by creating a Delete confirmation button so the User must confirm that they want to delete their account. I also changed the sidebar to be active whenever a user is not logged in so that the Log In and Sign Up buttons are always visible when token is null. I have also readjusted all of the buttons for every form screen to properly redirect to Home or Profile after their form submissions are completed. This is to give the user a response that something is happening and a result can be shown to the user by either being redirected to their Profile to see their newly created lyrics, or being redirected to the Home page after signing in.

All API Endpoint requiring a token are now working as expected and it seems like myself and the team have developed a much better understanding on how it works. We also started deployment today and were able to debug all of our pages for initial deployment.
